Here’s a **10-15 day schedule** to help you implement the tasks you’ve outlined using Assembly (ASM) alongside C and Bash. The schedule assumes 2-3 hours of work per day and focuses on building your knowledge incrementally. It also provides specific resources to consult.

### **Day 1: Basics of Assembly Language**

**Tasks:**

1. Understand assembly language syntax for your platform (e.g., x86, x86-64, or ARM).
2. Learn basic concepts like registers, memory addressing, and system calls.

**Resources:**

- _[Programming from the Ground Up](https://programminggroundup.blogspot.com/)_ (free book, x86 focus)
- Tutorials: _[x86 Assembly Guide](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/x86assembly/)_, [ARM Assembly Basics](https://azeria-labs.com/arm-assembly-quick-start-guide/)

---

### **Day 2: Setting Up the Environment**

**Tasks:**

1. Install necessary tools: `nasm` (Netwide Assembler), `as` (GNU Assembler), or equivalent for your platform.
2. Learn to compile and run ASM programs.
3. Write a simple “Hello, World” program in assembly.

**Resources:**

- Install tools: `sudo apt install nasm` (Linux), [NASM for Windows](https://www.nasm.us/)
- _"Hello, World" in Assembly:_ [Learn Assembly Language](https://asmtutor.com/)

### **Day 3-4: Unix System Calls in ASM**

**Tasks:**

1. Learn how to use system calls (`int 0x80` or `syscall`) in assembly.
2. Implement file operations like `open`, `read`, and `write`.
3. Experiment with simple programs to manipulate files.

**Resources:**

- _[Linux System Call Table](https://syscalls.kernelgrok.com/)_
- Example: [System Calls in x86-64 Assembly](https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/)

### **Day 5-6: File Handling in ASM**

**Tasks:**

1. Implement file handling tasks in ASM, such as:
   - Copying a file.
   - Appending content to a file.
2. Compare your ASM implementation with C/Bash equivalents.

**Resources:**

- [Examples of File I/O in ASM](https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2016/fall/cs301/lecture/10_11_assembly_io/)

---

### **Day 7-8: Implementing Text Processing Tools (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`)**

**Tasks:**

1. Create a basic `grep` equivalent in assembly using string-matching algorithms.
2. Start with fixed-pattern matching and gradually explore regex.

**Resources:**

- String Matching Algorithms: [GeeksforGeeks String Matching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kmp-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/)
- Example: [Assembly String Operations](https://asmtutor.com/)

### **Day 9-10: Multithreading and Synchronization in ASM**

**Tasks:**

1. Study how to implement multithreading in assembly using `clone()` or directly using `pthread_create`.
2. Write a program to demonstrate thread creation and synchronization with locks.

**Resources:**

- [Linux `clone()` syscall](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html)
- Pthreads Tutorial: [Beej’s Guide to Pthreads](https://beej.us/guide/pthreads/)

---

### **Day 11-12: CPU Scheduling Algorithms in ASM**

**Tasks:**

1. Implement simple CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS and Round Robin.
2. Simulate process queues using arrays or linked lists.

**Resources:**

- Algorithm Pseudocode: [CPU Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)
- Memory Management in ASM: [Memory Allocation in Assembly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42519760/how-to-allocate-memory-in-x86-assembly)

---

### **Day 13: Synchronization (Semaphores, Shared Memory, and Message Queues)**

**Tasks:**

1. Implement basic semaphore operations (up/down).
2. Experiment with shared memory and message queues using syscalls like `shmget`, `shmat`, and `msgsnd`.

**Resources:**

- [Semaphore Implementation in Assembly](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/semget.2.html)
- [Shared Memory in Assembly](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmget.2.html)

---

### **Day 14: Memory Management Algorithms**

**Tasks:**

1. Implement memory allocation algorithms (e.g., First Fit, Best Fit).
2. Write code to simulate memory placement and replacement (e.g., LRU).

**Resources:**

- Tutorials on Memory Management: [OS Memory Management](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-memory-management)
- Example: [ASM Stack and Heap Operations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41488372/how-to-implement-dynamic-memory-allocation-in-assembly)

---

### **Day 15: Disk Scheduling Algorithms**

**Tasks:**

1. Simulate disk scheduling algorithms (e.g., SSTF, SCAN) in ASM.
2. Optimize performance and compare with C implementations.

**Resources:**

- Disk Scheduling Algorithms: [Disk Scheduling Guide](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/disk-scheduling-algorithms)

---

### **Additional Resources**

- [Godbolt Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/): Great for seeing C code compiled into ASM.
- _Art of Assembly Language Programming_ by Randall Hyde.
- Forums: [StackOverflow Assembly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/assembly) and [Reddit Assembly](https://www.reddit.com/r/AssemblyLanguage/)

### **Tips**

1. Combine ASM with C/Bash: Write complex logic in C and inline critical sections in ASM using `__asm__`.
2. Debugging: Use tools like `gdb` to debug ASM programs.
3. Modular Approach: Implement smaller, testable components in ASM.
